Required:
	- [DONE] Each node knows latest average time to server.
		- Calculated by stream packet info in stream controller

	- ...

Process [TODO]:
	1. Client sends "Request Refresh" packet. Packet only with ID.
	2. Node receives "Request Refresh" packet.
		2.1 Nodes checks number of parents.
			2.1.1 Only one parent -> send "Request Refresh" to parent.
			2.1.2 More than one parent -> send "QRefresh" packet. Packet only with ID.
	3. Node receives "QRefresh" packet.
		3.1 Sends "ARefresh" to node that sent the "QRefresh" packet.
			- payload = current average time to server, timestamp, number of jumps from server
	4. Node receives "ARefresh" packet
		4.1 Calculates time to server: (receivedTimestamp - now) + receivedTimeToServer
		4.2 Increases number of jumps to server (++)
		4.3 Updates state
			4.3.1 Best parent node changed? Deactivate old stream, activate new stream.
